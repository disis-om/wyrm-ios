# Notices and attribution

Vlither Enhanced is maintained by **OM Rajput** and builds upon the open-source Vlither client originally published by `for-loop9`.

The repository preserves the GNU GPL v3 license governing the covered source. Vendored dependencies retain their own license and attribution files in their respective directories, including:

- SDL3 and its bundled components under `android-sdl/`
- GLFW under `glfw/`
- Dear ImGui and cimgui under `app/src/cimgui/`
- cglm under `thermite/include/cglm/`
- stb libraries under `thermite/src/external/stb/`
- Vulkan Memory Allocator under `thermite/src/external/vma/`
- bundled fonts under `app/res/fonts/`

Game assets, artwork, names and trademarks associated with Slither.io remain the property of their respective owners. Their presence does not imply endorsement or affiliation.

## NTL

Wyrm's Team Mode and tags interoperate with the **NTL MOD for Slither.io** by
`[NTL] Nothing To Lose`, and the tag artwork under `app/res/textures/wyrm_tags.png`
comes from that project's published tag set. The protocol notes in
`ntl-team-protocol.md` and `ntl-tags.md` describe NTL's own formats; the code
that speaks them is Wyrm's own.

Custom tags are authenticated by NTL's server against credentials the player
holds. Wyrm carries those credentials and displays what NTL returns — it does
not issue tags, and it cannot grant one to somebody who has not been given the
password for it.
